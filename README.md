## About building a theme

I knew almost nothing about creating a theme when I started this project, other than having previously customised
themes by adding my own 
[highlight groups](https://neovim.io/doc/user/syntax.html#highlight-groups).

#### Research

- [Presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/cocopon/creating-your-lovely-color-scheme)

  [iceberg theme](https://github.com/cocopon/iceberg.vim))
